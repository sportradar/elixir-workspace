  Analyze the test coverage of the workspace.

  You can use it to generate test coverage for one or more projects of the
  workspace. It will take care of finding the `coverdata` files, fixing the
  absolute paths with respect to the workspace root and formatting the
  results

      $ mix workspace.test.coverage

  ## Invocation requirements

  This task assumes that `mix test` has been executed with `--cover` and the
  `:export` option under `:test_coverage` set. It is advised to configure a
  workspace check that ensures that all projects have these options properly
  set.

  ```elixir
  [
    module: Workspace.Checks.ValidateProject,
    description: "all projects must have test coverage export option set",
    opts: [
      validate: fn config ->
        coverage_opts = project.config[:test_coverage] || []
        case coverage_opts[:export] do
          nil -> {:error, "export option not defined under :test_coverage settings"}
          _value -> {:ok, ""}
        end
      end
    ]
  ]
  ```

  > #### Test coverage configuration best practices {: .tip}
  >
  > It is advised to set the test coverage `:output` for all workspace projects
  > pointing to the same directory with the application name set as prefix. This
  > way you can easily cache it in CI pipelines.
  >
  > A custom check can be used to ensure it:
  >
  > ```elixir
  > [
  >   module: Workspace.Checks.ValidateProject,
  >   description: "all projects must have test_coverage[:output] properly set",
  >   opts: [
  >     validate: fn project ->
  >       config = project.config
  >       coverage_opts = config[:test_coverage] || []
  >       output = coverage_opts[:output]
  >
  >       cond do
  >         is_nil(output) ->
  >           {:error, ":output option not defined under :test_coverage settings"}
  >
  >         not String.ends_with?(output, Atom.to_string(config[:app])) ->
  >           {:error, ":output must point to a folder with the same name as the app name"}
  >
  >         true ->
  >           {:ok, ""}
  >       end
  >     end
  >   ]
  > ]
  > ```
  >
  > And in your projects `mix.exs`:
  >
  > ```elixir
  > test_coverage: [
  >   output: "path/to/common/app_name"
  > ]
  > ```


  In order to run the tests with `--cover` enabled for all workspace projects you
  should run:

      mix workspace.run -t test -- --cover

  ## Coverage thresholds

  The task supports two coverage thresholds, the error threshold and the warning
  threshold.

  The error threshold can be configured by setting the `:threshold` option under
  `:test_coverage` on the project's config. If not set it defaults to `90%`. If
  any project has a coverage below the error threshold then **the command will fail**.

  > #### Allowing project failures {: .tip}
  >
  > When restructuring a large codebase some extracted projects will not have the
  > desired coverage. Instead of setting a very low threshold or adding tests
  > directly, you can explicitely allow these projects to fail. In order to do this
  > you have to set the `:allow_failure` flag of the `:test_coverage` workspace
  > settings. For example:
  >
  > ```elixir
  > test_coverage: [
  >   allow_failure: [:project_a, :project_b]
  >   ...
  > ]
  > ```
  >
  > In this case the error messages will be normally printed, but the exit code of
  > the command will not be affected.
  >
  > Notice that this does not affect the output and exit code `mix test --cover` if
  > executed directly in the project.

  Warning threshold can be configured by setting the `:warning_threshold` option. If
  not set it defaults to `error_threshold + (100 - error_threshold)/2`. All project
  and module coverages that are below the warning threshold are logged as warnings.

  Notice that by default modules that have coverage above the warning threshold are
  not logged. You can force the logging of all modules by setting the `--verbose`
  flag.

  > #### Workspace overall threshold {: .info}
  >
  > Similar to the individual project's coverage the overall test coverage is also
  > calculated on the workspace level.
  >
  > In order to specify error and warning thresholds you need to set the corresponding
  > options under the `:test_coverage` key of the workspace settings, for example:
  >
  > ```elixir
  > test_coverage: [
  >   threhsold: 70,
  >   warning_threshold: 95
  > ]
  > ```
  >
  > Notice that the overall coverage will be reported only for the projects which are
  > enabled on each invocation of the `mix workspace.test.coverage` task

  ## Exporting coverage

  By default the coverage results are not exported but only logged. You can however
  specify one or more exporters in your workspace `:test_coverage` config. Each exporter
  is expected to be a function that accepts as input a workspace and a list of tuples
  of the form:

  ```elixir
  {module :: module(), path :: binary(), function_data, line_data}
  ```

  It is responsible for processing the coverage data and generating a report in any format.
  Officially we support the following exporters

  ### `lcov` exporter

  Generates an lcov file with both line and function coverage stats

  > #### Sample config {: .info}
  >
  > ```elixir
  > test_coverage: [
  >   exporters: [
  >     lcov: fn workspace, coverage_stats ->
  >       Workspace.Coverage.export_lcov(
  >         workspace,
  >         coverage_stats,
  >         [output_path: "artifacts/coverage"]
  >       )
  >     end
  >   ]
  > ]
  > ```
